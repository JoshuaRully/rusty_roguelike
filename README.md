# Rusty Roguelike

My version of the roguelike project from 'Hands on Rust' by Herber Wolverson.

## Learning Objective

I've thoroughly enjoyed video games since as early as I can remember and I've had a fascination with how they're designed and implemented since I was in elementary school. This project is meant to be a stepping stone into my hobby of game development. It seemed reasonable to start with Wolverson's textbook as I'm a huge fan of the roguelike genre and I had already worked through Will Crichton's cognitive engineering variant of the 'The Rust Programming Language' a year prior to starting this project.

## Long Term Objective

I plan on treating this repository as a playground for tinkering and experimentation as I learn more about the various disciplines of game development such as artwork, music, level design, etc.

### Personal Notes
1. Refactor code structure to adhere to perferred best practices
2. Serialize ECS for game saves
3. Implement particle effects
4. Attempt pixel art for assets
5. Attempt simple music loop
6. Attempt implementing controller support
